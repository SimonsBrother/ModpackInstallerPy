# Modpack Installer Py, because what if I made it in Java?
This is a simple, light tool to guide users through installing a Minecraft modpack, while still using the native Minecraft launcher, because other installers are quite heavy.

Users download the modpack from the link provided, and are guided through passing it to the application, which puts the files in the location (which effectively installs the modpack), while backing up any files being replaced.

This tool does not handle downloading the modpack. There is a link in the GUI to make downloading the modpack easier, but the application does not download this for the user.
I had created a redirect to a MEGA file, where the user could download the modpack from, so I could update the modpack and the redirect URL, and users could download the newer version as needed.
