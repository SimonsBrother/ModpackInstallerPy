# Modpack Installer Py, because what if I made it in Java?
Simple tool to guide users through installing a modpack.

Users download the modpack from the link provided, and are guided through passing it to the application, which puts the files in the location (which effectively installs the modpack), while backing up any files being replaced.

The link to downloading the modpack can be changed as necessary. I had created a redirect to a MEGA file, where the user could download the modpack from, so I could update the modpack and the redirect URL, and users could download the newer version as needed.
